# End-to-End-Object-Detection-Project

I used this repository to learn about Computer Vision and YOLO by creating a Object Detection Project.

## How to run : 

```bash
conda create --prefix ./sign-lang python=3.11 -y
```

```bash
conda activate sign-lang
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
